## Create your custom classifier

This folders contains sample images to train Watson Visual Recognition service on IBM Cloud. 

You can train Watson to recognise Angry Birds characters, Bluemix logo or help Watson differentiate good pizza from burned pizza. 

Choose a sample to get started! :smile:

Remember that you can always select your own set of images to train Watson. 

### If you create your own image collection:
  - It's recommended to provide at least 50 positive examples and 50 negative examples. 
  - A custom classifier's accuracy is reliant on the quality of the training images that are provided. 
  - Training images must be very similar to real 
  - Find a wide range of images. Consider: Lighting, angle, focus, color, shape, distance, presence of other objects, etc.
  - Split your images in two sets, one for training and one for testing (70/30)
